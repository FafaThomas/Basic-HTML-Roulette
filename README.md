Decision Roulette ðŸŽ¡
Decision Roulette is a simple, yet engaging, single-page web application that helps you make a choice by spinning a colorful wheel. It's built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a clean and interactive user experience.

Features
Interactive Roulette Wheel: A visually appealing and animated wheel that spins to a random outcome.

Weighted Chances: The chances of landing on a particular option change with each spin. The chosen option's probability is reduced by 50%, while the probabilities of the other options are increased, making it less likely to get the same result twice.

Persistent State: Uses localStorage to save the current probabilities, so your progress is saved even if you close the page and come back later.

Reset Option: A Reset Chances button allows you to restore all options to their initial equal probabilities.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

How It Works
The application uses JavaScript to handle the core logic:

An array of objects stores the options, their colors, and their current weight (probability).

When the Spin! button is clicked, a random number is generated and compared against the options' weights to determine a winner.

The wheel is then rotated with a CSS transform to land on the winning option, providing a smooth animation.

After the spin, the winning option's weight is reduced by 50%, and the remaining percentage is redistributed among the other options.

The new, adjusted weights are saved to localStorage, ensuring the changes are persistent.

The Reset Chances button clears the saved data from localStorage and restores the original weights.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure and content.

CSS3: For styling, layout, and the spinning animation.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the interactive logic, including chance calculation, state management, and DOM manipulation.

Getting Started
To run this project, simply download the index.html file and open it in any modern web browser. No server or build tools are required.

Known Issues
The labels on the wheel slices don't always align perfectly after the chances are adjusted. This is due to some tricky math involved in calculating the exact position and rotation for each label. I'm sure I could figure it out, but honestly, I'm a bit too lazy to tackle it right now. If you'd like to lend a hand, pull requests are welcome!
