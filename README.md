# Decision Roulette ðŸŽ¡

Decision Roulette is a simple, yet engaging, single-page web application that helps you make a choice by spinning a colorful wheel. It's built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a clean and interactive user experience.

## Features

* **Interactive Roulette Wheel:** A visually appealing and animated wheel that spins to a random outcome.

* **Weighted Chances:** The chances of landing on a particular option change with each spin. The chosen option's probability is reduced by 50%, while the probabilities of the other options are increased, making it less likely to get the same result twice.

* **Persistent State:** Uses `localStorage` to save the current probabilities, so your progress is saved even if you close the page and come back later.

* **Reset Option:** A **Reset Chances** button allows you to restore all options to their initial equal probabilities.

* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

The application uses **JavaScript** to handle the core logic:

1. An array of objects stores the options, their colors, and their current `weight` (probability).

2. When the **Spin!** button is clicked, a random number is generated and compared against the options' weights to determine a winner.

3. The wheel is then rotated with a CSS `transform` to land on the winning option, providing a smooth animation.

4. After the spin, the winning option's weight is reduced by 50%, and the remaining percentage is redistributed among the other options.

5. The new, adjusted weights are saved to `localStorage`, ensuring the changes are persistent.

6. The **Reset Chances** button clears the saved data from `localStorage` and restores the original weights.
